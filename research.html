                <br>
                Anthropogenic emissions into the atmosphere are central to many of the issues that plague planetary
                health, and there are great research and communication challenges in assessing their impacts and
                informing policy. These challenges motivate my research. I am focused on characterizing how
                anthropogenic emissions contribute to poor air quality and public health, how emissions of carbon
                dioxide contribute to climate forcing, how crops and forests are damaged by human emission activities,
                and how these broad components of planetary health can interact with one another.

                <h1>The air quality and health implications of increasing wildfires in the Amazon</h1>
                <p><b>Objective: </b>Assess the health impacts associated with increased PM2.5 exposure in Brazil during
                    the 2019 Amazon fire season. <br> <br>
                    <b>Summary:</b> GEOS-Chem adjoint senstivities of PM2.5 exposure in Brazil to emissions of primary
                    carbonaceous aerosols were calculated and then combined with biomass burning emissions from FINN
                    and QFED. Overall, we estimated that nearly 5000 premature deaths in Brazil in 2019 were associated
                    with fires between July and September and that the 2019 fire season led to more air quality impacts
                    than 2018.

                    <b>Summary:</b> The Group of Twenty (G20) countries are a collection of the world's largest and most
                    influential economies and are uniquely poised to take action to reduce the global health burden
                    associated with air pollution. We identified the leading contributors to air pollution in the G20
                    countries and estimated that hundreds of thousands of premature deaths could be
                    avoided from mitigation efforts targeting transportation and power generation emissions.

                    characterize the accrued benefits of larger and larger regions adopting a mitigation policy.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Summary:</b> For the 70.2 million people living in these cities, we estimate that 27740 PM2.5-
                    and O3-related premature deaths and 126600 NO2-related new asthma cases were attributable to air
                    pollution exposure in 2011. The findings suggest that the proportion of urban air pollution that is
                    regional is greater for premature deaths than new asthma cases and for the eastern US than the
                    western US.
